<h1>Work/decision log</h1>
<h3>I've decided to make this document to log the work that I do as I do it.</h3>
<hr/>

<h5>Day 1 - Mon, July 25th 2022</h5>
<h6>Start time: 1:40 PM MST</h6>
<h6>End time (for the day): </h6>
 After reading through the challenge, this is what I feel I'll need:

 - User table
  - User can create account
  - User can view the teas that are available to subscribe to
  - User can create subscriptions to specific teas
  - User can deactivate subscriptions
  - User can NOT delete a subscription. Once created, the subscription can either be __ACTIVE__ or __INACTIVE__, but it cannot be deleted
  - User can view all of their subscriptions, active or inactive
  - User table has:
    - ID
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email
    - Home address
    <br/>
    <br/>
 - Tea table
  - User can view the teas that are available to subscribe to
  - Tea has:
    - ID
    - title
    - description
    - temperature
    - brew time
    <br/>
    <br/>
 - Subscription table
  - User can create subscriptions to specific teas
  - User can deactivate subscriptions
  - User can NOT delete a subscription. Once created, the subscription can either be __ACTIVE__ or __INACTIVE__, but it cannot be deleted
  - User can view all of their subscriptions, active or inactive
  - The subscription table is the joins table between the __User table__ and the __Tea table__
  - Subscription table has:
    - ID
    - Title
    - Price
    - Status (active/inactive)
    - Frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
    - quantity(?)(Maybe? This is not MVP. Maybe include quantity in the descirption?)
    - User ID
    - Tea ID


The first thing I'll do from here: push to GitHub, create User Stories/project board w issues

<h3> Steps: </h3>

- Create user_table branch
- Generate User resources - `rails g resource User first_name last_name email shipping_address`
- This created:
  - User migration
  - Users controller
  - User model
  - The following routes:

```
users GET    /users(.:format)                     users#index
      POST   /users(.:format)                     users#create

 user GET    /users/:id(.:format)                 users#show
      PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)                 users#update
      PUT    /users/:id(.:format)                 users#update
      DELETE /users/:id(.:format)                 users#destroy
```

Now, i'll initialize RSpec and write a test to create a user and return it via the API

Add the following gems:
`rspec-rails, pry, capybara, launchy, simplecov, shoulda-matchers, orderly, figaro, factory_bot, faker, webmock, VCR, Faraday`

Bundle install (of course)

Then run: `rails g rspec:install`

- user validation tests
- user creation model tests

<h4> On to the tea table (actually the TAPI)</h4>

Firstly, I decided to use the [TAPI](https://github.com/victoria-lo/TAPI) rather than create a table.
This is for ease of use on my end, and to present myself with a bit of a challenge.

I'll be using the Facade/Service/PORO design pattern.<br>
I'm used to the file structure and I especially like working with POROS

I'll start by referencing another project that consumed an API.

At this point, I've made and tested my Tea Facade, Service, and PORO

<br><br>
Now, I'm moving on to getting a single tea.

I assumed the TAPI would use the Tea ID to get a single tea response, so I created a branch called `single_tea_by_id`. After reading the documentation, I found that the TAPI actually used the name/title of the tea to get a single response.

I wrote a test then made the TeaService method `get_tea_by_title(title)` to call the TAPI and return a single tea based on the `title` sent in to the method.<br>
This worked.

Now I'm writing a test to make sure the TeaFacade `get_tea_by_title(title)` returns a single Tea PORO using the response from `TeaService.get_tea_by_title(title)`
